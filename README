Bare-bones Blogger Template

A starting point for creating stripped-down Blogger templates, without needing to deal with Blogger's Template Designer/wizard and without (well, almost) the ugly template source code. Just add your own HTML markup + CSS and you're good to go (I might throw in a sample in the future).

Also includes my tweaked version of the archive widget that is provided by Blogger, configured to display all posts on a separate archive page (be sure to create an empty page called archive).
